# EMCCTimFiles
This repository includes source code files (demos, starter files, sample solutions, etc) related to my courses, [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@ProfTimEMCC), and written content. See my [GitHub landing page](https://timmcmichael.github.io/) for a complete directory of those resources.

## How to download these files

As a beginner, you may not be familiar with GitHub, so here's how to get the files you want. 

You do NOT need a GitHub account to download/copy code:

1. In the above file list, navigate to the relevant folder. The files are organized by the book or course first, with subfolders for each chapter or topic. 

2. Click on the file to display the source code:

3. Click the **download** button (circled in yellow in the screenshot)

*Note: the button to the left of the **download** button will copy the complete source code file to the clipboard so you can paste it into your IDE, which is convenient. However, be aware that in some cases (or all cases, in Java) the file name matters--so be sure to correctly name the file you paste into!*

## What is GitHub?
For beginners who aren't familiar with [GitHub](https://www.github.com), it is a service used to house software projects. GitHub implements a technology called *Git*, which offers a lot of advantages and features:
- It is accessible to multiple people (either publicly, or restricted to a specific group) so that a team of programmers can work on a project.
- It keeps track of--and manages--changes made to the project so people don't mess each other up as they work.
- It can be used to provide project documentation or wikis.
- It provides bug reporting and feature request functionality.

...and more.

A lot of open source projects are hosted on GitHub or similar services, and it's free to use in many situations. If you plan to work in the software development field, or you wish to contribute to open-source projects, you'll need to learn how to use Git/GitHub. I don't generally teach students how to use Git/GitHub in 100-level courses, but it is a nice way to manage your class work if you take the time to learn it.
