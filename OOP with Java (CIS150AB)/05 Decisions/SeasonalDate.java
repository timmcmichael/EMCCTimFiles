/*
 * Solution Walkthrough
 * Module 05
 * 
 * Create a class called SeasonalDate (in SeasonalDate.java) that includes separate fields for a day, 
 * month, and year; include get methods for each field. A constructor should accept values for each
 * of the fields and assign them appropriately. A method called getSeason() returns a String
 * indicating the astronomical season for the date using the ranges below:
 *  Spring starts March 20
 *  Summer starts June 21
 *  Fall starts September 23
 *  Winter starts December 21
 *    Note: These dates are based on equinoxes and solstices for 2023; for simplicity,
 *    your code can use these same dates regardless of the year.
 * Next, create a program in TestSeasonalDate.java that demonstrates SeasonalDate by creating multiple
 * instances of the class and outputting the seasons. This program does not require user input.
 * 
 * Test Cases:
 * 3/1/2023 -> Winter
 * 3/20/2023 -> Spring
 * 6/28/2023 -> Summer
 * 10/1/2022 -> Fall
